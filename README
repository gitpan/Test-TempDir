NAME
    Test::TempDir - Temporary files support for testing.

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::TempDir;

            my $test_tempdir = temp_root();

            my ( $fh, $file ) = tempfile();

            my $directory_scratch_obj = scratch();

DESCRIPTION
    Test::TempDir provides temporary directory creation with testing in
    mind.

    The differences between using this and using File::Temp are:

    *   If "t/tmp" is available (writable, creatable, etc) it's preferred
        over $ENV{TMPDIR} etc. Otherwise a temporary directory will be used.

        This is "temp_root"

    *   Lockfiles are used on "t/tmp", to prevent race conditions when
        running under a parallel test harness.

    *   The "temp_root" is cleaned at the end of a test run, but not if
        tests failed.

    *   "temp_root" is emptied at the begining of a test run
        unconditionally.

    *   The default policy is not to clean the individual "tempfiles" and
        "tempdirs" within "temp_root", in order to aid in debugging of
        failed tests.

EXPORTS
    temp_root
        The root of the temporary stuff.

    tempfile
    tempdir
        Wrappers for the File::Temp functions of the same name.

        The default options are changed to use "temp_root" for "DIR" and
        disable "CLEANUP", but these are overridable.

    scrach
        Loads Directory::Scratch and instantiates a new one, with the same
        default options as "tempfile" and "tempdir".

    File::Temp, Directory::Scratch, Path::Class
